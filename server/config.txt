#How many levels of importance in cache

#Range for each level, it gets multiplied by each level number i.e
#CACHE_RANGE*i where 0 <= i < MAX_NUM_LEVELS and starting from end;
#so for example at level CACHE_NUM_LEVELS - 1 we will have files that have been 
#referenced at least CACHE_RANGE*0 to CACHE_RANGE*1 but excluding just inserted files.
#It only implies in one way, it is not guaranteed that the only files that are referenced int range of the level
#are 100% inside that level.
#must be > 1
CACHE_RANGE=2
#This value gets multiplied by MAX_NUM_FILES to create extra space in cache 
#hopefully for better performance. (from test it emerged that this value has to be small)
